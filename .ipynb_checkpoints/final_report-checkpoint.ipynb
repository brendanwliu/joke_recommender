    "Recommender systems are techniques that attempt to suggest relevant items to users from very large and complex datasets. The dataset used includes over 4.1 million continuous ratings (-10.00 to +10.00) of 100 jokes from 73,421 users collected by Ken Goldberg and Theresa Roeder and Dhruv Gupta and Chris Perkins at UC Berkeley. Specifically, our joke recommender system will implement collaborative filtering methods to filter items that a user may like based on similar users. Using model based approaches uncover user-joke interactions which are then used to make further recommendations. This report will discuss specific matrix decomposition methods, component analysis and use a K-nearest neighbors approach to compare to a classic matrix approach. "

    "## Introduction\n",
    "Recommender systems are quintessential in the connected world. Many different businesses often face the arduous task of recommending items to users without knowing the preferences of said users. Starting in the 1990â€™s research in recommender systems have grown significantly and have developed great efficiency in predicting the preferences of users.1 According to Zhu et al., a recommender system is based on three important pieces of data: users, items (e.g., movies, jokes, news), and user-item usage history (e.g., ratings). The goal is to attempt to understand the relationship between the users, items and user-item history, and to use that understanding to predict future user-item interactions.2 To tackle these tasks, over the last three decades, researchers have developed methods like non-negative matrix factorization (NMF), K-nearest neighbors (KNN), neural autoencoders, and many more. These models can be further grouped into several categories, among which a very important branch is collaborative filtering (CF).\n",
    "\n",
    "CF can be implemented using many different approaches. The central data source of a CF method is the user-review matrix, with each entry corresponding to a numerical rating of an item within a finite itemset. These matrices tend to be extremely sparse, with many users and items. Our application of matrix methods attempts to find and extract a low ranking representation of the original user-ratings matrix.\n",
    " \n",
    "In our work, we explore three different matrix decomposition methods for topic discovery and user clustering; and, we also utilize a KNN approach to recommending jokes to users.\n"

    "To make the joke text machine readable, we used the TF-IDF vectorization technique. After vectorizing and normalizing the term-matrix, we used NMF to decompose this matrix instead of truncated singlular value decomposition (tSVD). This is because there is no interpretability of the negative values in tSVD. NMF ensures that the resulting decomposed term frequency matrix has interpretable positive values. NMF decomposes the matrix according to this algorithm:\n",

In order to visualize our data, we performed principal component analysis (PCA), a statistical procedure that finds orthonormal transformations of variables called principal components. We performed an associated matrix factorization technique known as truncated singular value decomposition (tSVD) to decrease computation time and complexity. By using SVD, we cut our computation time in half. \n",

A strong elbow curve indicated that each new component added positively increase the total variance explained, and is expected using tSVD.
