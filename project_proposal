Final Project Proposal -- Jester Joke Recommender System

Group Members: Brendan Liu, Joshua Kim, Elaine Sieng, Yerem 

Dataset: Using data from the Jester Online Joke Recommender System, where a total of 73422 users have rated up to 100 jokes.
UserRatings1.csv contains the ratings provided by the first 36710 users.
UserRatings2.csv contains the ratings provided by the last 36711 users.
The dataset is arranged such that the initial users have rated higher number of jokes than the later users.
The rating is a real value between -10.0 and +10.0.
The empty values indicate that the user has not provided any rating for that particular joke.
